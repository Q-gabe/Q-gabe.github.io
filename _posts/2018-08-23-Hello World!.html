I am so excited to finally release a working version of this website. This website was a weekend spent entirely deciphering the Jekyll system which runs on Ruby (which I'm running on Windows, risky) as well as breaking down some of the more advanced HTML and CSS formatting techniques used in this website. Of course, I did not build this entirely from scratch and started off with a template which you can view <a href="https://github.com/chrisbobbe/jekyll-theme-prologue">here</a>!<br>
<br>
Coming from only knowing basic HTML and CSS, this has been a healthy challenge as well as a portfolio boon! I dedicate this first ever post to self improvement, my family, my girlfriend and to my endless pursuit to knowledge. I may not be very good now at writing code but I will get good!!
<br>
<br>
Have a great day everyone! â˜º<br>
