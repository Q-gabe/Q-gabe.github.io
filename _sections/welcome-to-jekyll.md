I'm <strong>Gabriel Ong</strong>, a Software Engineer based in Singapore with an interest in problem solving and developing scalable and forward-looking solutions.

From a young age, I have had a strong passion for all things science and learning about how things work, constantly seeking to expand my knowledge to answer questions I had about the world around me. This drive eventually led me to pursuing Computer Science as my major in my tertiary education. The skills I have picked up along the way have enabled me to think more computationally but also critically about how I can best utilize technology for the betterment of those around me. As I continue this lifelong journey of learning, this site serves to document and showcase some of my experiences.

My interests are currently in Full Stack Development and Cloud Computing.
