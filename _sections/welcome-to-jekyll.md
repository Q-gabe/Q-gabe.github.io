I'm <strong>Gabriel Ong</strong>, a Singaporean Year 2 undergraduate in the National University of Singapore majoring in Life Sciences, with a hobby of tinkering with codes and programming.

I have a major love for all things biology and aiming to study more Neuroscience-related modules in my later academic years in NUS. Given the amount of computational work and data analysis in not just Neurobiology but biology in general, I decided it would be a smart move to spend more time expanding my computing skills!
