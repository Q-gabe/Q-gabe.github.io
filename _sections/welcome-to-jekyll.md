I'm <strong>Gabriel Ong</strong>, a Singaporean Year 2 undergraduate in the National University of Singapore majoring in Computer Science, with a hobby of tinkering with codes and programming.

I have a major love for all things science since a young age and finding solutions to problems has been a long passion of mine. Eventually, my endeavours led me to pursuing Computer Science in my tertiary education, aiming to specialize in full-stack development, AI and Machine Learning in my next 2 years in NUS. Given the amount of coding we do in school and my skillset, I decided it would be a smart move to spend more time expanding (and showcasing ;) ) my computing skills!
