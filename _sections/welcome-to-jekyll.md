I'm <strong>Gabriel Ong</strong>, a Singaporean Year 3 undergraduate in the National University of Singapore majoring in Computer Science, with a hobby of tinkering with codes and programming.

From a young age, I have had a strong passion for all things science and learning how things work, using my knowledge to solve problems and answer questions. This eventually led me to pursuing Computer Science as my major in my tertiary education. My interests are currently in full-stack development, AI and Machine Learning. Given the amount of coding we do in school and my skillset, I decided it would be a smart move to spend more time expanding (and showcasing ;) ) my computing skills!
