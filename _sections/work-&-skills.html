<p>I have worked as an intern in Changi General Hospital as a Microbiology Lab Technician alongside the microbiology lab team there for an academic year in polytechnic. Together with my FYP partner, I also did my Final Year Thesis, doing rigorous lab work and subsequent data analysis of the antimicrobial resistances of hypermutagenic strains of <i>Pseudomas aeruginosa</i> from various samples taken from patients suffering from chronic lung diseases. Working together and receiving guidance from a team of highly trained lab techs and supervisors made the experience one of the most enriching experiences I ever had. The study was subsequently presented at the CGH/EHA Annual Scientific Meeting in 2014. You can access the paper <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277305759_Detection_and_antimicrobial_susceptibility_testing_of_hypermutable_strains_of_Pseudomonas_aeruginosa_in_patients_with_clinical_infections">here</a>.</p>

<p>My coding proficiencies include C, Java, Python, JavaScript and HTML5. I aim to eventually achieve the skills required for full-stack development and other software design.</p>
