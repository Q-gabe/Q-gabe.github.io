<p>I have worked at Whizpace, a networking hardware start-up based in Singapore, as a software engineer intern. Working directly with Whizpaceâ€™s CTO and the development team, I contributed in the strategy and development of the software architecture for various products. I developed a GUI overhaul patch for one of their devices and integrated a Microsoft Azure Cloud solution with one of their products for IoT data monitoring. Along with a peer, I led the development of a novel Windows application for one of their products for offline data monitoring.</p>

<p>My coding proficiencies include C, Java, Python, JavaScript, among other languages. I am also familiar with using other JS frameworks and have some experience in Windows application development. I am also comfortable in using Windows, Linux and OS X platforms. I plan to learn so much more in journey to becoming a better developer.</p>

<p>I have also interned at Changi General Hospital as a Microbiology Lab Technician for a year in polytechnic. My final year thesis involved planning and doing rigorous lab work and subsequently tons of statistical data analysis on the antimicrobial resistances of hypermutagenic strains of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> from isolated from patients suffering from chronic lung diseases. The study was subsequently presented at the CGH/EHA Annual Scientific Meeting in 2014. You can access the paper <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277305759_Detection_and_antimicrobial_susceptibility_testing_of_hypermutable_strains_of_Pseudomonas_aeruginosa_in_patients_with_clinical_infections">here</a>.</p>
